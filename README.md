What are you working on web app
Waywo allows you to do one thing: enter in what you are working on.

Then through location based services, whatever you are working on shows up on a feed for your area. If you have common interests
with someone's project to discuss a partnership, and you can provide resources/advice to someone if you have done something similar.
At the end of the day, it's supposed to inspire people to take part of independent projects they are passionate about by 
seeing others' projects. 

Still in development phase. Waywo.org
